# SimpleObservableErrorHandling

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

After breaking out some Google Fu, I found a killer article on working with observables in Angular - [Angular 8 Observables Example | Observables In Angular](https://appdividend.com/2018/12/08/angular-7-observables-tutorial-with-example/).

You should be able to start this example with:

```sh
$ npm run start:example:angular-cli-simple-observable-error-handling
```

If you have made changes to any of the Docker related files or the `package.json` for this example, please use:

```sh
$ npm run start:example:angular-cli-simple-observable-error-handling:clean
```

Your application should be available at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200):

When you are finished, simply press CTRL+C to spin down the app:

```sh
^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping explore-angular-tour-of-heroes ... done
```

Finally, you can spin down and remove the Docker container(s) for this app with:

```sh
$ npm run stop:example:angular-cli-simple-observable-error-handling
```

## Cheat sheet

Here are the commands we followed from the tutorial mentioned above:

```sh
# Make sure we're in the appropriate directory after generating our Angular app ðŸ¤“
$ cd examples/simple-observable-error-handling/

# Create an Angular service
$ ng g s student --spec=skipTests

# Create src/app/student.model.ts
# Add the demo data inside src/app/student.service.ts
# Create a getStudents function to publish an observable in src/app/student.service.ts
# Subscribe to the newly created observable in src/app/app.component.ts
# Output results in the console
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
