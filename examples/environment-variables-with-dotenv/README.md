This example was inspired by [Configure Frontend Projects With Dotenv](https://codingsans.com/blog/configure-frontend-projects-with-dotenv).

## Getting started

Let's generate a new app using `npx` and the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) using CSS as our stylesheet format and **NOT** using Angular routing:

```sh
$ npx @angular/cli new app --style=css --routing=false
```
