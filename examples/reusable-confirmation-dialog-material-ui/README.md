This example was inspired by [Create a reusable confirmation dialog in Angular 7, using Angular Material](https://firstclassjs.com/create-a-reusable-confirmation-dialog-in-angular-7-using-angular-material/).

## Getting started

Let's generate a new app using `npx` and the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) using CSS as our stylesheet format and **NOT** using Angular routing:

```sh
$ npx @angular/cli new app --style=css --routing=false
```
