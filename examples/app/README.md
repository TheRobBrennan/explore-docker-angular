# App
The simplest example is the default app generated by `ng new app` - available in this project at `./examples/app`

Assuming you have followed the "Initial Setup" guide above, you should be able to start this example with:

```sh
$ npm start
```

Your application should be available at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200):

To verify this is working properly, make a minor modification to `src/app/app.component.html` and verify that the page has automatically refreshed with your changes.

This app has also been enhanced to allow testing using Chrome on the local computer as well as headless Chrome within the Docker container itself by running `npm test` or `ng test`:

For [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) users, this example also includes a launch configuration to debug the app natively within the IDE:

When you are finished, simply press CTRL+C to spin down the app:

```sh

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.17.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
