# Welcome

This project is meant to serve as a starting point for exploring [Angular](https://angular.io) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

## Initial setup

### Docker

The easiest way to use this repo is to have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and configured on your development machine.

### Angular CLI

Once you have Docker installed, you will need to have the latest version of the Angular CLI installed on your development machine per the [guide](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) available on the [Angular](https://angular.io) site:

```sh
# Verify that you have Node.js v10.9.0 or later installed (https://nodejs.org)
$ node -v
v12.13.0

# Verify that the npm package manager has been installed
$ npm -v
6.12.0

# Install the Angular CLI globally
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Getting started

Once you have configured your development environment - including installing Angular globally - you can generate a new workspace and example Angular app:

```sh
# Navigate to the examples folder to create your app
$ cd examples

# Use the Angular CLI to generate a new app
$ ng new app

```
